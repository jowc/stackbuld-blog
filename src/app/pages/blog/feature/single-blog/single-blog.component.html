                They encourage customers to consider adding complementary or related items to their cart.

                This not only increases the average order value but also creates a more comprehensive shopping
                experience.

                The concept of order bumps takes advantage of the psychological principle of impulse buying.

                When customers are already in a buying mood, they are more likely to respond positively to well-placed
                additional offers.

                This is particularly effective when the offers are related to the products someone is already interested
                in.

                Letâ€™s say a customer is purchasing a gardening tool. Showcasing other gardening-related products as
                order bumps can make their purchase more complete and appealing.

                And if you look at the numbers, the power of this technique is clear.

                Implementing order bumps can lead to a significant increase in revenue.
